This Repository contains a port scanner toolthat  i made as my internship in Tamizhan Skills

⚙️ How It Works
1. Takes target IP/domain and port range as input.
2. Uses threading to scan multiple ports simultaneously.
3. Displays open ports in real-time.

🛡️Radar is useful for:
1. Basic reconnaissance during cybersecurity assessments
2. Learning how port scanning works under the hood
3. Demonstrating Python threading and socket programming
